We are not too concerned about what is behind us, dirving forward while looking backwards is not the best idea. That's why we do data selection. Why now? Data selection should be performed after division to train and test set, otherwise we are exposed to data leakage problem. We will perform dataselection with SelectKBest from sklearn package. With K you define how many features you want to select. During making of the first video I was able to get the robot to autonomously navigate in the race track with decent precision with as low as 10 features. For the second video where I tried to make the robots race I had to increase the number of dimensions to 80 to get it to work. Even with such a high number of dimensions Arduino still seem to work well."
